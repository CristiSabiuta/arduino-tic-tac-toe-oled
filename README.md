# Arduino TIC-TAC-TOE game 

This project showcases an implementation of the classical Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in an embedded environment using an Arduino, a 0.96 inch OLED display and two buttons.

The schematic is presented in the figure below:


In the Player vs CPU game mode, the CPU plays totally random (in an empty box). An intelligent algorithm (minimax) will be implemented in a future version.
